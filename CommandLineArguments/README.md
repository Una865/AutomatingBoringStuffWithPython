# Command line arguments using argparse

## argparse is a command-line parsing module in the Python
Examples of use of argparse:

 - **replaceWords.py** : the python script takes one argument from command line which represents the text file (in my case **test.txt**) from which it needs to extract text which will be processed. The code is replacing every occurence of **ADJECTIVE, NOUN or VERB** with words from the user input. The processed text then write in a text file **results.txt** (one example is written).
