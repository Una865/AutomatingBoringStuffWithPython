# AutomatingBoringStuffWithPython

This book by AI Sweigart gave me an insight of all the cool things I can do from the command line and make my daily activities easier.
Before reading this book I never used my python scripts outside of pycharm or similar. Everything that I've done with the code was in a code editor environment. At the beigning of this book I've learned about using arguments from command line and even modifying clipboard with executing some python scripts. But all of that was done behind my monitor and in a matter of seconds I could have copied text changed in a format that I wanted and pasted on the clipboard. Furthermore I was introduced to WebScrapping and all the other cool stuff. 

This book also have proposed projects at the end of each chapter which I will post here. I noticed that I very easily forgot some tools that I learned in the book or while searching the internet to finish the project. In order to maybe save some time later when I would need those tools I decided to come back to this book and save my notes and codes here. Also, maybe someone else who is also reading this find out about this repository and find it helpful or have an advice on how to improve something. In both ways it is a benefit for everyone so I am more than keen to write this repository as good as I can.

Have fun!
